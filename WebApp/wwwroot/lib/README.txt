This directory is for client-side libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery.

In a production environment, you would typically:
1. Use LibMan (Library Manager) to install client-side libraries
2. Or manually download and place the libraries in appropriate subdirectories:
   - /lib/bootstrap/
   - /lib/jquery/
   - etc.

For development purposes, you can use CDN references in your layout file.
